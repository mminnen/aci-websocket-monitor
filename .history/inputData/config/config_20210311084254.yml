##### ACI Websocket Monitor Container - Configuration #####
###########################################################

# This config file describes essentially three things:
#   - The connection between the Websocket and APIC Controller
#   - Which ACI Objects are meant to be monitored
#   - How the Websocket Container proceeds with the received information/logs

##### APIC Connection Settings #####
# required settings: IP Address/FQDN, Username, Password
# Certificate Based Authentication is not supported for Websocket setup, because
# no Token is generated that way, and the Token is required for the Websocket.

##### THESE SETTINGS ARE MANDATORY #####

# Example:
# apic-login:
#   address: "1.2.3.4"
#   username: "testuser"
#   password: "h1ghly-secure-p@ssw0rd"

apic_login:
  address: "10.49.208.146"
  username: "pmathy_elk"
  password: "C!sco123"

##### Monitored MO Settings #####
# This part of the configuration contains the MOs which are supposed to be 
# monitored. These are specified by providing their DN. If none are specified,
# by default faultInst objects are monitored.

##### THESE SETTINGS SHOULD BE SPECIFIED #####

# Example:
# monitored_objects:
#   - "/api/node/class/faultInst"
#   - "/api/node/class/faultDelegate"
#   - "/api/class/fvTenant"

monitored_objects:
  - "/api/class/fvTenant"

##### Data Output Settings #####
# This Configuration part describes what the container does with the data it 
# receives from APIC according to the subscriptions. The following are currently
# possible:
#   - Write to file in data directory (requires mapped volume to access)
#   - Forward through REST POST call to data collector (e.g. Logstash etc.)
#
# If no target is specified, the container defaults to Write to File.
# If multiple are specified, all will be executed in the following order:
#   - REST Forwarding
#   - Write to File
#
# Rest Forwarding currently supports Basic Auth with Username/Password.
# These are optional, if Auth is not required.

##### THESE SETTINGS SHOULD BE SPECIFIED #####

# Example:
# data_output:
#   toFile:
#     baseFilename: "testOutput"
#   toRest:
#     ssl: False
#     destAddress: "1.2.3.4"
#     destPort: "8000"                             (optional)
#     username: "testrestuser"                     (optional)
#     password: "4noth3r-secure-p@ssw0rd"          (optional)

data_output:
  toFile:
    baseFilename: "testOutput"
